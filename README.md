# Alarm System:Wireless Smoke Detector
Sample source code for DIY PR13. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to interface RF module PT2272 (decoder) further read the status of a smoke detector. It explains the method construct a microcontroller system to read sensor status wirelessly. It can further be modified to become safety monitoring system.

There is 3 folder which are Source code( .c and .hex), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
